# WB-Template
This is the starting point for websites made by White Buffalo. White Buffalo is a small company based in Hopkins, MN that makes apps and websites. 

The documentation throughout the files is written assuming that the person using this template knows beginning HTML and CSS.  

The template relies heavily on Twitter Bootstrap. It uses PHP for its Contact Form and to use require_once for content that would otherwise need to be repeated. 

index.php and about.php can be used as templates for additional pages.
header.php contains meta tags and references to the css files. It should be placed between the <head> tags.
nav.php is a top navigation that uses Twitter Bootstrap for responsiveness.
footer.php contains the html for the footer.
js-files contains the references to the javascript files used throughout the website. It should be placed after the footer.php file. 

The other files are for a variety of special types of web screens.
contact.php and contactAction.php is a contact form template.
gallery-modal.php and gallery-slider.php are two Bootstrap options for photo galleries.
picture-quiz.php is a picture quiz.
puzzle.php is a jigsaw puzzle.
quiz.php is a quiz.
word-find.php is a word-find game.
